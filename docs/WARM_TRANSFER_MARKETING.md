# 🔥 Warm Transfer Feature - Marketing Guide

## What is Warm Transfer?

**Warm Transfer** allows your team to seamlessly hand off a live AI call to a human agent—without the customer ever being put on hold or disconnected.

Think of it as a professional "tag team" handoff: while the customer continues chatting with the AI, your human agent is called separately, briefed on the situation, and then connected when ready.

## 💡 Key Benefits for Marketing

### 1. **Zero Hold Time**
> "Your customers never wait on hold again"

The AI keeps the customer engaged while simultaneously connecting to the human agent in the background.

### 2. **Agent Preparation**
> "Your team answers prepared, not surprised"

Agents hear a custom announcement before connecting:
- *"You have an incoming transfer from a customer asking about roof repairs. They mentioned water damage and live in Austin."*

### 3. **Seamless Handoff**
> "From AI to human in seconds, no dropped calls"

The transition is so smooth, customers often don't realize they were talking to AI first.

### 4. **Real-Time Dashboard Control**
> "One-click transfer from your live call dashboard"

Supervisors can see all active calls and initiate transfers with a single click.
